As of somewhere around 11/17/2009 Sirius changed things I rewrote 
some of sipie to fix it. Remove your ~/.sipie/ directory and 
rerun and it will ask your username and password again and should work.

to install
in ubuntu

Make sure mutliverse is enabled, if not enable it
    grep multiverse /etc/apt/sources.list

if nothing returns go to System -> Administration -> Synaptic Package Manager
        Settings
        -> Repositories
        -> Ubuntu Software
        -> Software restricted by copyright or legal issues (multiverse) 
            CHECK THAT

then 
    # python-wxgtk2.6 is option but it currently works better then the pure
    # gtk interface
    apt-get install mplayer python-setuptools python-wxgtk2.6

    # easy install sipie
    easy_install sipie
