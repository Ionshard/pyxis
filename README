Command Line XM and SIRIUS Radio Player - Pyxis

USAGE:
Currently the command line interface is the most stable and the default player
and running `./sipie` while in the working directory, in a terminal and
filling in the requested information is all that is required to get going.


ABOUT:
Pyxis is a wrapper that provides access to SIRIUS' internet radio streams through the command line. Pyxis is written entirely in python.

Pyxis is a large rewrite of the original project Sipie written and maintained by Eli Criffield at http://sipie.sourceforge.net/ and none of Pyxis would have been possible without Sipie's authentication code. Big thank you to Eli Criffield.

The reason for Pyxis's existence is because in recent years development on Sipie has slowed and as such when SIRIUS changes something the time required to bring it back to a working version can sometimes be a long time. So a couple of us decided to rip out all the largely unused portions of Sipie, refactor a lot of it and bring it into a more stable and adaptable package. Thus Pyxis was born when we realized we could no longer pretend it was still Sipie.
