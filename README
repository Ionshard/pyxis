SIRIUS Radio Python Player - Sipie

This is an implementation of SIRIUS and XM sattelite radio player using Python.

Currently the command line interface is the most stable and the
default player and running `./sipie` while in the working directory,
in a terminal and filling in the requested information is all that is
required to get going.
